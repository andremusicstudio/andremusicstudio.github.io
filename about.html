        Conductor, David André, a California native, commenced his music studies at age five receiving his
        baccalaureate degree from San Francisco State University and his master’s and doctorate degrees from
        the University of Washington. A contrabassist with the Seattle Symphony, he also served as principal
        of that section in the San Jose Symphony, chairman of the Cabrillo College music department, and
        assistant conductor for the internationally acclaimed Cabrillo Music Festival. A finalist in the Georg
        Solti Conducting Competition in 1972, he then became music director for the symphonies of Everett, Maui
        & Port Angeles, which he toured through China in 1985. He became music director of the Tulare County
        Symphony in 1985, and in 1992 was designated “An American Cultural Specialist” by the U.S. State Department.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since that time André has been guest conducting many of the major symphony orchestras of the world every
        year, including those in Moscow, Vienna, St. Petersburg, Prague, Kazan, Budapest, Kiev, Minsk, Sofia,
        and many others. Much of his guest appearances have also found him in Central America, Mexico, Canada,
        and of course, the United States. He has served as chief conductor for the Alicanti Music Festival in
        Spain and the Arcady Music Festival in Maine, was engaged by the U.S. State Department to conduct the
        National Symphony of the Ukraine for the 10th anniversary celebration of U.S. diplomatic relations with
        the former Soviet States, and was invited by the Russian Ministry of Culture to be the first American
        to conduct the Russian National Folk Orchestra. A fine, gifted conductor, David André is committed to
        programming music that motivates every orchestra with whom he has worked. He is also dedicated to
        providing the entertaining element in his programs that gratifies the audience. His conducting is
        instilled with extraordinary care and insightful comprehension. The mark of a true music conductor is
        to inspire the individual players to exceed their own personal goals and to band them together in meeting
        the collective challenge. David André has shown repeatedly that orchestras under his masterful direction
        do realize their very best.

        Born in Volgograd, Russia, Galina André graduated from music school as a young child and subsequently
        received her diploma from the music college of Volgograd and her masters's degree in viola from the
        Rachmaninoff Conservatory. For the following eight years she performed with the Volgograd Chamber
        orchestra, principal, the Volgograd Opera Theatre, co-principal, and the State Philharmonic Symphony
        Orchestra of Volgograd.
        In 1997 she married American conductor David André and moved to the United States, where she performed
        as a violist with the symphonies of Monterey, Fresno, and Tulare County. She has maintained a studio of
        violin and viola for the past fifteen years, and her students have received national and state awards,
        performing in state and national honor ensembles.
        Having created and developed a vibrant string program for St. Paul's School, she recently began
        developing a similar program at St Frances Cabrini School. In addition, she teaches privately in the
        André music studios in Cupertino and San Jose.
