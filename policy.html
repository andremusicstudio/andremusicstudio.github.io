            <h4>Students Responsibilities</h4>
            The student agrees to arrive at each lesson punctually, well prepared, and with all necessary
            materials. Student must take good care of the music instrument, keep their nails short, and hands
            clean.

            <h4>Parents Responsibility</h4>
            The Parents to provide an instrument in the best possible condition, a metronome, and a place
            allowing quiet and uninterrupted  practice. Be helpful, interested and supportive. Parents are
            welcome to attend lessons at any time.

            <h4>Teacher Responsibilities</h4>
            The teacher will provide:
            -a positive, supporting and enthusiastic atmosphere for learning
            -information where to rent and how to care for your instrument
            -musical materials

            <h4>Tuition</h4>
            Tuition is due on, or before the first lesson of each month. Parents should calculate the amount
            of lessons in the upcoming month and make a payment. We accept cash or checks. Make checks payable
            to Galina Andre

            <h4>Cancellations</h4>
            Please think and plan ahead, and remember your lesson time. If you need to cancel a lesson, make
            every effort to give the teacher as much notice as possible, at least 24 hours. If it possible one
            can exchange lesson times with another student.

            <h4>Arrival</h4>
            Plan to arrive a couple minutes before your lesson. Please remove your shoes and leave them on the
            landing inside the front door. Allow enough time before your lesson to unpack your violin and wash
            your hands. Students who are late cannot be guaranteed a full lesson.

            <h4>Teacher Cancellation</h4>
            Lessons that I cancel for any reason will be rescheduled or credit will be given towards the next
            month's tuition.

            <h4>Preparedness</h4>
            Please bring all the materials that I have requested. If photo-copied music was given during the
            lesson, please keep it neatly in a folder so that it won't get lost or damaged.
            Long ﬁngernails prevent the development of good violin technique and make it impossible to play
            musically. I might ask students who arrive to the lesson with ﬁngernails that are too
            long to trim/ﬁle them at the lesson.

            <h4>Contact Me</h4>
            If you would like to contact me for any reason (to ask questions, to cancel the lesson etc.),
            sending an Email andremusicstudio@gmail.comor sending a text (559-731-3315) is the fastest way to
            reach me. I do check emails and text messages frequently. You can also call me directly (559-731-3315).
            However, I don't answer the phone during lessons. In that case, you can leave me a message.
